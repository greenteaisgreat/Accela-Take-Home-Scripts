// If you need to write a helper (e.g., for date arithmetic), wrap it inside the
//  same file and comment its purpose.
// handle edge cases! (e.g., missing contact, missing ASI field,
//  no parent record, inspection not “Fail”)?
// handle API failures gracefully; (e.g., if (!result.getSuccess()) { logDebug(...) return; })
//  also be sure to include appropriate debug/log messages to indicate what
//  would happen at runtime! Use logDebug(...) (or comments) to indicate where you would log errors or informational messages.
